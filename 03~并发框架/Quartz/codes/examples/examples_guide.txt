Welcome
=======

Welcome to the Quartz Examples directory.  

This directory contains 15 examples that show you how to use various
features of Quartz.   Each example is located in its own subdirectory. 
Every example can be run using Windows .bat files or Linux/UNIX .sh files.  

Additionally, each example directory contains a readme.txt file.  Please 
read this file first, as it will contain useful information for running 
the examples.

Running the Examples
====================

The examples can be run from the examples folder of the repository, such as this:

../gradlew :examples:runExample1

or

../gradlew :examples:runExample4

or etc.


Note that examples 12 and 13 require running two process (this will need to be
done in separate terminals, or on separate machines):

For Example 12 you need to first run the "server" portion, and then run the
"client" portion of the example:

../gradlew :examples:runExample12Server
../gradlew :examples:runExample12Client

For Example 13 you need to run two instances (two cluster members):

../gradlew :examples:runExample13Instance1
../gradlew :examples:runExample13Instance2
