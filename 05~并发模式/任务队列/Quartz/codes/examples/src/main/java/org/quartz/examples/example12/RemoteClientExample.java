/**
 * This example is a client program that will remotely 
 * talk to the scheduler to schedule a job.   In this 
 * example, we will need to use the JDBC Job Store.  The 
 * client will connect to the JDBC Job Store remotely to 
 * schedule the job.
 *
 * This example demonstrates how Quartz can be used in a client/server
 * environment to remotely scheudle jobs on a remote server using
 * RMI (Remote Method Invocation).
 *
 * This example will run a server that will execute the schedule.  The
 * server itself will not schedule any jobs.   This example will also
 * execute a client that will connect to the server (via RMI) to
 * schedule the job.  Once the job is remotely scheduled, the sceduler on
 * the server will run the job (at the correct time).
 *
 * Note:  This example works best when you run the client and server on
 * different computers.  However, you can certainly run the server and
 * the client on the same box!
 *
 * Port # used for RMI connection can be modified in the example's
 * property files
